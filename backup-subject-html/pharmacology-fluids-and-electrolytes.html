					</div>					<div id="ex-content" class="explanation-container"><p>Deficiency of the B vitamins, other than vitamin B12, is rare in the UK and is usually treated by preparations containing thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), and nicotinamide.</p>
<p>The severe deficiency states Wernicke’s encephalopathy and Korsakoff’s psychosis, especially as seen in chronic alcoholism, are best treated initially by the parenteral administration of B vitamins (Pabrinex®), followed by oral administration of thiamine in the longer term.</p>
<h4>Administration</h4>
<p>For prophylaxis of Wernicke's encephalopathy 1&nbsp;pair of ampoules of Pabrinex I/V high Potency are given once daily for at least 3 – 5 days by intravenous infusion or deep muscular injection.</p>
<p>Oral thiamine should be continued long-term in harmful drinkers if they are malnourished or at risk of malnourishment or if they have decompensated liver disease.</p>
<h4>CHM Advice</h4>
<p>Although potentially serious allergic adverse reactions may rarely occur during, or shortly after, parenteral administration of thiamine, the CHM has recommended that:</p>
<ul>
<li>this should not preclude the use of parenteral thiamine in patients where this route of administration is required, particularly in patients at risk of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome where treatment with thiamine is essential</li>
<li>intravenous administration should be by infusion over 30 minutes</li>
<li>facilities for treating anaphylaxis should be available when parenteral thiamine is administered</li>
</ul>
