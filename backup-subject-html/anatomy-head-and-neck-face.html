					</div>					<div id="ex-content" class="explanation-container"><p>The facial vein is the major vein draining the face. It originates near the medial corner of the eye from the union of the supratrochlear and supraorbital veins, receives tributaries draining the eyelids, the external nose, the lips, cheeks and chin throughout its course, and drains into the internal jugular vein.</p>
<h4>Connections</h4>
<p>As it crosses the face, the facial vein has numerous connections:</p>
<ul>
<li>near the medial corner of the orbit, it communicates with ophthalmic veins</li>
<li>in the area of the cheek, it communicates with veins passing into the infraorbital foramen</li>
<li>it also communicates with veins passing into deeper regions of the face i.e. the deep facial vein connecting with the pterygoid plexus of veins</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cavernous Sinus</h4>
<p>All these venous channels have interconnections with the intracranial cavernous sinus through emissary veins that connect intracranial with extracranial veins. There are no valves in the facial vein, or any other venous channels in the head, so blood can move in any direction. This means infections of the face, primarily above the mouth, should be treated with caution to prevent the dissemination of infectious material in an intracranial direction.</p>
<p>Although cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is rare, it most commonly has an infectious aetiology (most commonly from spread of infection from the sinuses or middle third of the face, or less commonly secondary to dental abscess or orbital cellulitis).</p>
