					</div>					<div id="ex-content" class="explanation-container"><h4>Transmission</h4>
<p>Transmission is mainly through infected blood.</p>
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>healthcare workers</li>
<li>blood transfusion recipients</li>
<li>intravenous drug users</li>
</ul>
<p>Sexual transmission and vertical transmission do occur but are uncommon.</p>
<h4>Clinical Features</h4>
<p>Infection may cause a mild hepatitis but many cases are asymptomatic; fulminant disease is rare. In about 20% of cases infection is cleared by the immune system but patients are not immune to future HCV infection.</p>
<p>HCV infection persists in up to 80% of patients, who are at high risk of&nbsp;developing cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma between 10 - 30 years later.</p>
<h4>Diagnosis</h4>
<p>Diagnosis is by&nbsp;detection of anti-HCV IgG antibodies which indicate if a person has ever been infected with HCV (resolved or current infection). If the antibody test is positive, HCV RNA should be tested for, which if positive indicates that a person has current infection with active hepatitis C.</p>
<h4>Treatment</h4>
<p>Hepatitis C is a notifiable disease.</p>
<p>Treatment is with combination therapy initiated by a specialist, usually with ribavirin and pegylated interferon, and often combined with a newer medication such as simeprevir or sofosbuvir; response is best in patients with particular genotypes and those with low initial viral loads but about 70- 90% will clear the virus.</p>
<p>Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for people with end-stage liver disease.</p>
<p>There is no HCV vaccine available currently.</p>
