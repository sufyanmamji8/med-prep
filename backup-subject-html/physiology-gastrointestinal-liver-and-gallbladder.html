They have a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic end and in aqueous solution, bile salts orient themselves around droplets of lipid forming micelles to keep the lipid droplets dispersed.</p>
<h4>Production</h4>
<p>Bile acids are synthesised from cholesterol by hepatocyte and excreted into bile. Synthesis of new bile acids occurs as needed to replace bile acids that are excreted in the faeces.</p>
<p>The principal primary bile acids are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. They are made more soluble by conjugation with taurine or glycine in the liver.</p>
<h4>Enterohepatic Circulation</h4>
<p>Of the bile acids excreted into the intestine, about 95% are reabsorbed into the portal circulation by active transport mechanisms in the distal ileum and recycled by the liver.</p>
<p>Many of the bile salts are reabsorbed unaltered, some are converted by intestinal bacteria into secondary bile acids (deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid) and then reabsorbed and a small proportion escapes reabsorption and is excreted in the faeces.</p>
<h4>Function</h4>
<p>The main functions of bile acids are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emulsification of lipids to increase the surface area available for digestion by pancreatic lipase</li>
<li>Micelle formation to facilitate lipid transport and absorption</li>
<li>Stimulation of bile production by osmotically attracting water and electrolytes into the bile canaliculi</li>
<li>Regulation of bile acid synthesis via negative feedback</li>
</ul>
