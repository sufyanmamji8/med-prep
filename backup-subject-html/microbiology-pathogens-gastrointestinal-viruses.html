<h4>Epidemiology</h4>
<p>Norovirus is the most common cause of viral infectious gastroenteritis in the UK.&nbsp;In contrast to rotavirus infection, norovirus infection can occur in people of all ages because immunity to it is not long lasting.</p>
<p>Norovirus is typically associated with outbreaks of acute self-limiting diarrhoea and vomiting (sometimes projectile) in hospitals, care home, schools, nurseries and in other confined communities. Infection is transmitted primarily by the faecal-oral route but it can also be transmitted by contact with an infected person, consumption of contaminated food or water, or contact with contaminated surfaces or objects.</p>
<h4>Clinical Features</h4>
<p>The incubation period is usually about 24 - 48 hours and the duration of symptoms about 12 - 60 hours. Nausea and vomiting is followed by watery diarrhoea which may be associated with fever, headache and myalgia.</p>
<p>Virus replication occurs in the mucosal epithelium of the small intestine resulting in flattening of the villi and hyperplasia of crypt cells.</p>
<h4>Diagnosis</h4>
<p>Diagnosis is usually clinical but laboratory diagnosis is important for epidemiological purposes and can be confirmed with NAAT from stool samples.</p>
<h4>Treatment and Prevention</h4>
<p>Treatment is supportive with fluid replacement. Prevention is by isolation, ward closure, and good hand-washing technique.</p>
