It should be noted that, within any one compartment, there must be electrical neutrality, i.e. the total number of positive charges must equal the total number of negative charges.</p>
<h4>Intracellular vs Extracellular Fluid</h4>
<p>The most important difference is the relative concentrations of the cations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) is the principal extracellular cation; approximately 140&nbsp;mmol/L (93%) is extracellular and 10 mmol/L (7%) intracellular.</li>
<li>Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) is the principal intracellular cation; approximately 4&nbsp;mmol/L is extracellular (3%) and 140&nbsp;mmol/L intracellular (97%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the other cations, most Ca<span style="vertical-align: super;">2+</span>&nbsp;in the cell is transported actively either out of the cell or into the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, leaving very low levels of free&nbsp;Ca<span style="vertical-align: super;">2+&nbsp;</span>in the intracellular fluid. Mg<span style="vertical-align: super;">2+&nbsp;</span>is a predominantly intracellular ion.</p>
<p>Intracellularly the main anions are protein and phosphate, whereas extracellularly the main anions are chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>).</p>

<h4>Na/K+ ATPase Pump</h4>
<p>Ion channel proteins allow the cell to determine the flow of ions across its own membrane. In most circumstances, relatively few channels are open so that the leakage of ions is low. There is, however, always a steady movement of ions across the membrane, with Na<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>and K<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>following their concentration gradients into and out of the cell, respectively. Uncorrected, the leak would lead to the equalisation of the compositions of the two compartments, effectively eliminating all bioelectrical signalling. This is prevented by the action of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;ATPase pump which is effectively responsible for maintaining the ionic gradient between the intracellular and extracellular fluid.</p>
<h4>Gibbs-Donnan Equilibrium</h4>
<p>Negatively charged intracellular proteins (and other large fixed anions e.g. phosphate ions) that cannot cross the plasma membrane of cells, effectively repel Cl<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;ions, which can diffuse freely across the plasma membrane, forcing them out of the cell. The electrical force driving the Cl<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;ions out is balanced by the chemical gradient driving them back in, a situation known as the Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium.</p>
