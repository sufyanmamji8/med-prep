					</div>					<div id="ex-content" class="explanation-container"><p>Two Taenia spp. infect humans, the pork tapeworm and the beef tapeworm.</p>
<p>Infection is acquired by eating raw or undercooked contaminated meat from the intermediate host (pig or cow) that contains the tissue stages of the parasite. The larvae mature into the adult form in the small intestine and eggs are released and excreted in the faeces, continuing the infectious cycle.</p>
<p>Despite the size of the worm, tapeworms are often asymptomatic but&nbsp;may cause abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea and compete for nutrients.</p>
<h4>Cysticercosis</h4>
<p>The pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, can use humans as an intermediate host as well as the definitive host.</p>
<p>Infection occurs through ingestion of food or water contaminated with eggs.</p>
<p>The eggs hatch into larvae in the intestine which enter the bloodstream and disseminate, forming multiple cyst-like lesions (cysticercosis) in the muscles, skin, eye and brain (neurocysticercosis). Inflammatory responses to parasitic antigen found in the brain may lead to seizures.</p>
<h4>Diagnosis</h4>
<p>Diagnosis of tapeworm is by direct visualisation of characteristic eggs in stool. Cysticercosis is diagnosed by specific ELISA and confirmed by the demonstration&nbsp;of cysts with radiological imaging.</p>
<h4>Treatment</h4>
<p>Niclosamide [unlicensed] (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is the most widely used drug for tapeworm infections and side-effects are limited to occasional gastro-intestinal upset, lightheadedness, and pruritus; it is not effective against larval worms.</p>
<p>Praziquantel [unlicensed] (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is as effective as niclosamide.</p>
<p>Specialist advice should be sought for the management of neurocysticercosis.</p>
