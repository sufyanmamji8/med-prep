					</div>					<div id="ex-content" class="explanation-container"><p>A systematic review (SR) is a formalised and stringent process of searching and identifying, critically evaluating, and selecting for inclusion based on predefined quality criteria, all relevant studies (both published and unpublished) surrounding a particular clinical question. Systematic reviews are the gold-standard source of research evidence in the hierarchy of research evidence.</p>
<p>Systematic review achieves:</p>
<ul>
<li>refinement and reduction - large quantities of information are refined and reduced to a manageable size</li>
<li>efficiency - SR is quicker and less costly to perform than a new study, it can prevent others from embarking on an unnecessary study and can shorten time between medical developments and their implementation</li>
<li>generalisability and consistency - results can often be generalised to a wider population in a broader setting than would be possible from a single study, consistencies in the results from different studies can be assessed and inconsistencies determined</li>
<li>reliability - SR aims to reduce errors and so tends to improve the reliability and accuracy of recommendations</li>
<li>power and precision (meta-analysis has greater power to detect effects of interest and provides more precise estimates than a single study)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Meta-Analysis</h4>
<p>A meta-analysis the quantitative assessment of a systematic review. It involves combining the results of independent studies with common features to produce a more powerful overall estimate of effect. A meta-analysis can provide conclusive evidence for or against an intervention, even when individual studies are inconclusive.</p>
<p>In meta-analysis of RCTs, the outcome data from each trial are usually illustrated as a series of odd ratios with their confidence intervals on a graph known as a forest plot.</p>
