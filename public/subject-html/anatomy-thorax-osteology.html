					</div>					<div id="ex-content" class="explanation-container"><p>There are twelve pairs of ribs, each terminating anteriorly in a costal cartilage.</p>
<h4>True and False Ribs</h4>
<p>The ribs are divided into 'true' and 'false' ribs based on their anterior attachments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The true ribs (1 - 7) attach directly to the sternum anteriorly.</li>
<li>The false ribs (8 - 12) can be further divided into those that attach to the costal cartilage of the rib above them (8 - 10) and the floating ribs (11 + 12) that do not have any anterior attachments.</li>
</ul>

</div></div><p></p>
<h4>Posterior Joints</h4>
<p>Posteriorly, all of the ribs articulate with the thoracic vertebrae of the spine.</p>
<p>Each typical rib forms two joints posteriorly:</p>
<ul>
<li>the costotransverse joint (between the tubercle of the rib and the transverse process of the corresponding vertebra)</li>
<li>the costovertebral joint (between the two facets on the head of the rib and the superior costal facet on the body of the corresponding vertebra, and the inferior costal facet on the body of the vertebra above).</li>
</ul>

</div></div><p></p>
<h4>Typical Ribs</h4>
<p>The typical rib consists of a head, a neck and a body:</p>
<ul>
<li>The head of the rib has two articular facets which articulate with the superior costal facet on the body of the corresponding vertebra, and the inferior costal facet on the body of the vertebra above.</li>
<li>The neck of the rib connects the head to the body. Where the neck meets the body, there is a tubercle which articulates with the transverse process of the corresponding vertebra.</li>
<li>The body of the rib is flat and curved.</li>
</ul>
<p>The inferior margin of the internal surface of the body is marked by the costal groove which protects the neurovascular structures which run within it.</p>

<p>The atypical ribs consist of ribs 1, 2, 10, 11 and 12.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rib 1 is shorter and wider than the other ribs. The head of rib 1 has only one facet for articulation with the body of its own vertebra (T1); it does NOT articulate with vertebrae C7. The superior surface of rib 1 is characterised by the scalene tubercle about midway along the body, which separates two smooth grooves in the rib made by the subclavian vein anteriorly and the subclavian artery posteriorly.</li>
<li>Like rib 1, rib 2 is flat but twice as long. It has a roughened area on its upper surface where the serratus anterior muscle attaches.</li>
<li>The head of rib 10 only has a single facet for articulation with the body of its own vertebra (T10).</li>
<li>Ribs 11 and 12 have no neck, and have only one facet for articulation with the bodies of their own vertebrae (T11 and T12).</li>
</ul>
