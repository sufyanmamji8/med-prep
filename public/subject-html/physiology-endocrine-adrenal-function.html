Cortisol is secreted from the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex.</p>
<h4>Regulation of Cortisol Secretion in Health</h4>
<p>Cortisol release is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary, which in turn is released in response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus. Cortisol has a negative feedback effect on the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary gland, inhibiting release of CRH and ACTH respectively.</p>
<p>The effects of cortisol are mediated by intracellular receptors that translocate to the cell nucleus after binding the hormone.</p>
<p>Cortisol is released during the course of normal physiological activity in a pulsatile pattern. Cortisol release displays a circadian rhythm, with the highest levels in the early morning.</p>
<h4>Regulation of Cortisol Secretion in Stress</h4>
<p>The primary stimulus for the increased release of glucocorticoids is stress, which is the result of exposure to adverse situations.</p>
<p>Stress response:</p>
<p>The stress response is driven by the amygdala, part of the forebrain that stimulates:</p>
<ul>
<li>activity in the hypothalamic CRH neurons</li>
<li>activity in the sympathetic nervous system</li>
<li>activity in the parasympathetic nerves that cause acid secretion in the stomach</li>
<li>the feeling of fear</li>
</ul>
<p>The actions of the two parts of the adrenal gland are complementary in response to stress.&nbsp;Catecholamines are released from the adrenal medulla to produce a rapid increase in cardiac output and the mobilisation of metabolic fuels. Corticosteroids produce a slower, more sustained response.</p>

<h4>Effects of Cortisol</h4>
<p>Cortisol acts to:</p>
<ul>
<li>raise plasma glucose by stimulating gluconeogenesis in the liver and inhibiting peripheral glucose uptake into storage tissues</li>
<li>increase protein breakdown in skeletal muscle, skin and bone to release amino acids</li>
<li>increase&nbsp;lipolysis from adipose tissues to&nbsp;release fatty acids</li>
<li>and at higher levels...
<ul>
<li>mimic the actions of aldosterone on the kidney to&nbsp;retain Na+ and water and lose K+ ions</li>
<li>suppress the action of immune cells</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
