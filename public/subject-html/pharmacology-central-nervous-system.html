					</div>					<div id="ex-content" class="explanation-container"><h4>Mechanism of Action</h4>
<p>Aspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and the resulting inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis results in analgesic, antipyretic and to a lesser extent anti-inflammatory actions. Low-dose aspirin also has an important antiplatelet activity through inhibition of thromboxane-A2 synthesis. The inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the gastric mucosa can result in gastrointestinal damage.</p>
<h4>Indications</h4>
<p>Aspirin is well absorbed orally and has a duration of action of about 4 hours. Aspirin is indicated for headache, transient musculoskeletal pain, dysmenorrhoea, and pyrexia.&nbsp;Aspirin is a first-line option for the management of migraine. In most circumstances where analgesia is required, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen) are preferred to aspirin, because they are better tolerated.</p>
<h4>Contraindications</h4>
<p>Aspirin (at analgesic doses) is contraindicated in:</p>
<ul>
<li>People with a history of true hypersensitivity to aspirin or salicylates (symptoms of hypersensitivity to aspirin or salicylates include bronchospasm, urticaria, angioedema, and vasomotor rhinitis)</li>
<li>People with previous or active peptic ulceration</li>
<li>People with haemophilia or another&nbsp;bleeding disorder</li>
<li>Children younger than 16 years of age (risk of Reye's syndrome)</li>
<li>People with gout, or a history of gout (aspirin increases the level of uric acid)</li>
<li>People with severe cardiac failure (analgesic dose)</li>
<li>People with severe hepatic impairment (increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding)</li>
<li>People with severe renal impairment&nbsp;(increased risk of deterioration of renal function and GI bleeding)</li>
</ul>
<p>N.B. Owing to an association with Reye’s syndrome, aspirin-containing preparations should not be given to children under 16 years, unless specifically indicated, e.g. for Kawasaki disease.</p>
<h4>Cautions</h4>
<p>Aspirin (at analgesic doses) should be used with caution in:</p>
<ul>
<li>People who may be at high risk of increased bleeding — for example those receiving treatment with warfarin, NSAIDs, SSRIs, corticosteroids, or other drugs known to increase bleeding</li>
<li>People with asthma or allergic disease (may precipitate bronchospasm)</li>
<li>People with uncontrolled blood pressure</li>
<li>People with thyrotoxicosis</li>
<li>People with G6PD deficiency</li>
<li>People with dehydration or renal impairment</li>
<li>Elderly people (at higher risk of complications)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Side Effects</h4>
<ul>
<li>Increased risk of&nbsp;bleeding</li>
<li>Gastrointestinal adverse effects including irritation, bleeding, ulceration and dyspepsia</li>
<li>Bronchospasm and asthma attacks in patients with asthma</li>
<li>Skin reactions in hypersensitive patients</li>
</ul>
<h4>Overdose</h4>
<p>The main features of salicylate poisoning are hyperventilation, tinnitus, deafness, vasodilatation, and sweating. Coma is uncommon but indicates very severe poisoning.</p>
