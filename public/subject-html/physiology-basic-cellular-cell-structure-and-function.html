<h4>Nucleus</h4>
<p>The nucleus contains most of the cell's genetic material organised as chromosomes. It also contains the nucleolus, a membrane-less structure which is responsible for the production of ribosomes.</p>
<h4>Mitochondria</h4>
<p>Mitochondria are responsible for the production of chemical energy in the form of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, which is then used by all energy-requiring reactions. Mitochondria are also involved in other cellular processes, including Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and signalling. Mitochondria contain a small amount of maternal DNA.</p>
<h4>Endoplasmic reticulum</h4>
<p>The smooth endoplasmic reticulum serves as a store for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and is the major site of lipid production (including triglyceride, steroid and phospholipid synthesis).</p>
<p>The rough endoplasmic reticulum has ribosomes bound to its outer surface, which are responsible for protein assembly and post-translational processing of proteins. This includes trimming amino acid chains to the right length, protein folding, addition of polysaccharide chains and identification of improperly folded proteins, which are tagged for subsequent destruction by lysosomes.</p>
<h4>Golgi apparatus</h4>
<p>The Golgi apparatus packages proteins for delivery to specific intracellular destinations or into vesicles which can then be secreted from the cell for extracellular action.</p>
<h4>Lysosomes</h4>
<p>Lysosomes, containing digestive enzymes, are responsible for the digestion and breakdown of unwanted and defective proteins, the recycling of raw materials and the prevention of accumulation of waste.</p>
